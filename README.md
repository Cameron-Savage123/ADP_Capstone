My entities I was responsible was Subject and Tutor Subject. Subject work perfectly as I demonstrated to sir in the presentation. Tutor Subject was the bridging table.
My code for subject was already added in the main so I did not have to upload it again. For application security I had difficulties to upload it to gitbuh. So Angelo uploaded our work of application security on github.
#### The files I uploaded is my work contribution to the application security
